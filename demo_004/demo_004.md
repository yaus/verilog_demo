# DEMO_004

Thing to learn:
1. Finite State Machine (**FSM**)
2. Cross Clock Domain Logic

---
## FSM
Finite State Machine is most important part in the logic design, since any logic with memory can be descriped as a stat machine. Also, generating **any** logic sequence require a FSM. It can be mearly machine or moore machine.

---
## Cross Clock Domain logic
Asynchornous  is one of the problem of the digital circuit. Since, the  mechanism of "clocked" circuit is base of data
